article_body: "<p><h1>\"I can't expect them to keep it from exploding like last time!\"</h1></p><p><b>LUNAPORT</b> -- Trouble brews for Nanotrasen and the Lunaport Authority's reclamation of the Helicon Refinery as spontaneous protests erupted through out the colonies.</p><p>This is the latest in a series of setbacks that have plagued the project which so far has included an ill-timed materials shortage from major mining companies such as Hafgan and BlastoTek earlier to targeted harassment of surveyors. Presently, the situation seems to be escalating further as security officials have reported waves of violence amongst the crowds. If witnesses are to be believed, victims of such violence often join the crowd soon after. Witnesses who have avoided involuntary recruitment into the crowds claim that they overheard one of the leader figures in the crowd state that they're attempting to stop Nanotrasen from building a new refinery before they plan to \"blow up the moon and launch the debris straight to Earth!\".</p><p>\"I mean, I can't expect them to keep it from exploding like last time!\" says one former chief engineer who has requested to stay anonymous. \"We still don't know what caused the Helicon disaster and let's be honest, I'm not sure if I trust Nanotrasen to keep it safe in the long run after all the s**t's they've gone through. Hell, with the way things are going, I won't be surprised if this becomes the lead up to a sequel to the Pod Wars just like that ammo ship that blew up a decade ago.\" he remarked. It should be noted that this sentiment isn't shared by everybody within these protests. Reports indicate that other reasons include a general distaste for Nanotrasen's support of other companies operating on Luna and her colonies.</p><p>As of the time of writing, security officials are awaiting further instruction from Central Command and is advising everyone to stay indoors.</p>"
