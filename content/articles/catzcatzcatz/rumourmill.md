article_body: "<p>\"Heya! It's Miller here. I've got sweet juicy info from an insider from the <i>Somnus Center for Cryogenics</i> involving a off-the-books collaboration with Nanotrasen</p><p>They told me that most of it was very hush-hush with everyone in the sleeper. Hell, they joked about it being so under wraps, only one person on Nanotrasen's side knows. On one shift, they heard one of the technicians talking about preparing for an expedition. So, we're both assuming that the center is secretly funding the new mission Nanotrasen's been hyping up over the past few months. My money's that they're getting test subjects for a new cryo unit for their ship and boy, that'd be one hell of a good investment.\"</p>"
