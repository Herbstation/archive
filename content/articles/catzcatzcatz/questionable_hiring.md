article_body: "<p><b>LUNAPORT</b> -- On paper, <i>all employees</i> are loyal and of sound mind while working for the company. In actual practice, it is anything but within the stations of Nanotrasen.</p><p>During 2053, multiple inspectors were sent to investigate less than ideal workplace conditions amongst the Frontier. A lack of basic monkey handling training within Genetics. Chefs who cleaved and butchered every animal or living creature they see. Apathy at the sight of at least several murders.</p><p>One inspector described one shift as utterly horrifying and absolutely disgusting maelstrom of gore guts as one suspected member of the Syndicate had smuggled in a device to violently eject the contents of their stomach. Later on, a background check revealed that for several months, Nanotrasen had been knowingly or unknowingly hired ex-Syndicate members over several months. \"I'm flabbergasted that they allowed these folk walk free. Let alone enter their stations.\"</p><p>One reports that he once entered a station where everything seemed to be fine, until they entered the engine room, where they discovered that it was running at speeds which jostled and cracked the floors around it. \"It was a disaster waiting to happen. The engineering team laughed at me for suggesting to slow it down. A Thermo-Electric Generator shouldn't be running so fast like that. For all you could know, one of the turbines might fail or worse, cause breakage between the hot and cold loops that could have caused the room to violently over-pressurize and destroy most of the station.\"<p>Nanotrasen has not responded to a request for comment by Lunaport Liberties.</p>"
