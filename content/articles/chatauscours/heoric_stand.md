article_body: "<p><b>THUNDRANDO, BANSHEE PIT</b> -- Security Assistant Bjeurn Seuz, a Nanotrasen crewmember, part of the <i>NSS Intrepid</i> project has realised a truly unbelievable feat of killing an entire pack of wolves with a single can opener. According to him, he found himself cornered by a group of four wolves, alone and weaponless, he has remembered that he stowed a tactical can opener in his boots. Using this makeshift tool he has courageously fended off the beasts killing all of them, but got badly injured in the process. He has managed to crawl back to the landing site of the <i>NSS Intrepid</i> and passed out. Security Assistant Bjeurn Seuz was found by the medical technicians minutes later and treated for his injuries. Dr. Rumi Seelig expects that the hero will make a full recovery, even though as Bjeurn put it, \"a wolf's bite is nothing to bark at\".</p><p>Following the incident, the heroic security assistant confided in our journalist that he is planning to lead a team of security officers into the den of the wolves thus solving the issue in its stem.</p>"
