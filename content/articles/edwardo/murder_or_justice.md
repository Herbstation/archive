article_body: "<p><b>THUNDRANDO, BANSHEE PIT</b> -- Three colonists lie dead after what seemed like a peaceful if loud and poorly timed protest. The protesters, after trying to break into the bridge of the ship, were detained and brought into security for questioning. Not long after, screams and sounds of taser discharge were heard in Security. Shortly after, it was declared the three leaders of the protest had been executed in accordance with martial law. Per an interview with <i>The Thundrando Times,</i> Captain Quinn Sinclair -- who who took part in the execution -- said, \"We planned to let them go but they were risking the safety of others [so] we had to execute them.\"</p><p>The execution was reported to have been carried out via stabbing per to the Detective, i.e. myself, saying \"Yeah, I stabbed them to death, more resource efficient then using ammo.\"</p><p>Allegedly, the protesters pulled out slam guns and knives and proceeded to try and assassinate the Captain and Head of Security. But, with the executions happening behind closed doors and only security's word, who can say what really happened?</p><p>More on T02.</p>"
