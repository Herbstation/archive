article_body: "<p><b>THUNDRANDO, BANSHEE PIT</b> -- Thundrando medical staff was hit by unexpectedly heavy workloads yesterday as previously-undiagnosed medical issues quickly started coming to light. With intensifying snowstorms blocking off access to most of the colony overnight - including the newly-founded medical ward - patients flooded available facilities with complaints of nausea and abdominal pain.</p><p>We spoke with Thrush Roach, medical technician for Thudrando colony, about the situation.</p><p>\"We've had lots of patients come in with appendicitis\", Dr. Roach shared. \"I do worry that there may be some underlying cause that we haven't found.\"</p><p>As medical staff rushed additional surgical capacity into place, patients had to grit their teeth as they awaited treatment.</p><p>Meanwhile, other cases suggested a different underlying cause.</p><p>\"We've also had lots of crew come in with signs of food poisoning\", Dr. Roach continued. \"Normally we'd use antibiotics so they can return to work quickly and painlessly but...

Which I think some crew members may need regardless...\"</p><p>Most cases have been linked to colony catering, which struggles to keep up with demand as initial supplies dwindle and cargo deliveries are commandeered for mission-critical infrastructure.</p><p>When asked for a final recommendation for the crew, Dr. Roach warned the crew against the dangers of frostbite.</p><p>\"After some cases yesterday I realized some crew may not realize how dangerous this is. We've been getting really bad cases, and in those cases, well...\" She hesitated before continuing, \"the only real fix is amputation.\"</p><p>She cautioned crew to stay vigilant, maintain proper nutrition and hydration, avoid alcohol and tobacco use, as well as exercising extreme caution when venturing outside the colony.</p>"
