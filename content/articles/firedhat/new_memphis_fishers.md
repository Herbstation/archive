article_body: "<p><b>NEW MEMPHIS</b> -- The four-time winning Frontier League Baseball team revealed today that the New Memphis Fishers will declare bankruptcy by the end of the quarter. While all FLB teams have struggled in bringing spectators into the sport, the Fishers represent what many market observers have portended as the first domino in an ever escalating series of buy-outs and failures. FLB Commissioner Girard \"Bambino\" Ruth addressed the team's struggling finances and lack of viewership during the 2053 season, where the Fishers performed at their worst in the entire history of the team's existence with a 19-36 record. \"The proud legacy of a great team is at stake here. We've seen generations of players filter through the ranks of the Fishers and to see them brought to their knees from a bad storm breaks this New Memphian's heart. Who can imagine the modern game without them?\"</p><p>Generally, the performance of the entertainment sector across Frontier shows stagnation. Many other extrasolar entertainment empires are showing their cracks, with failure risks on the horizon.</p><p><font size = 2><b>More on T04</b></font></p>"
