This was meant to be the fourth and final canonical round of 35 Below. The code, it seems, was of a different opinion.

The round was beset by technical issues from the beginning, with doors crushing crewmembers, transparent shuttle walls, and several atmos bugs that caused the server to slow to a crawl. The rollout of this round's antagonists was also delayed, with the Soviets only making planetfall 55 minutes into the round. Ultimately the round was killed by an infinite recursion bug in faction announcement code.

*The Truth And Lies That Give Us Hope* was rerun the next week to a much greater success, with the bugs fixed and additional time put into fleshing out the round's unique content.

Nevertheless, this round, although now non-canon, still had some fun interactions, documented below.
