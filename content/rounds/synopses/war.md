The War Round was the sixth public round of 35 Below. It was a non-canon deathmatch between the Soviet and Nanotrasen forces, with some Syndicate flavoured surprises. This was the last 35 Below event held.

At roundstart, two teams were spawned, the Nanotrasen forces, starting planetside, and tasked with setting up colony defences, and the Soviet forces, starting aboard the Korolev, and tasked with preparing a battle plan to take the NT colony on the surface.

Each team had a set of "respawners", that if destroyed, would prevent future waves of players from being spawned, effectively delivering victory to the remaining team. For Nanotrasen, these were the clone pods in Medbay, and for the Soviets, these were their cryopods aboard the Korolev.

Midway through the round, a detachment of Syndicate agents were spawned to throw some chaos into the event. They teleported down from the Cairngorm into a secret mountain lair.

Ultimately, the round came to an end in the same way R4.1 did, with an infinite recursion bug in faction announcement code, which killed the server. A fitting end, really. That said, Nanotrasen was heading to board the Korolev, and was projected to win the round after surviving a brutal Soviet assault.
