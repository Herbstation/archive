In order to allow the Soviets time to familiarise themselves with their equipment without eating into the time of R4, several acclimatisation rounds were held.

The first was held a few hours prior to R4.1, and went smoothly. The latter two were held a day before R4.2, and uncovered a round-ending bug with the Kharkovchanka, which was fixed before R4.2. This was again determined to be an infinite-recursion bug. There seems to be a running theme here.

For their extrasolar mission to X4-6A, the Soviet Union selected the base *Tatanya* for training, located on a frigid world orbiting Fugere, the red star of their home system. High Command members Yelizaveta Kuznetsova, Genady Nikolaivich, and Nikolai Yabintsky were to oversee training and inform the crew of their mission objective; to rendezvous with the *Novy Mir* and determine its fate.

The Soviets were able to test their loadouts, grenades, and the Kharkovchanka, an armed fighting vehicle, often referred to as the tank, the snowcruiser, or the APC. Following this, they were able to use the *Zarya* dropship to board the *Korolev*, their mothership, and explore its facilities.
