synopsis: We return to the burgeoning colony two weeks later in _To Build A Fire_, the second public round of 35 Below. Doused in snow and with but a few scant, barren rooms to call home, some of the crew begins questioning why they're really out here in a frozen crater on a desolate moon.<br><br>The crew works hard to continue establishing the colony, building out shells of rooms into full fledged areas: a cozy bar and kitchen, a medical wing with cloning equipment, a growing hydroponics bay, and an established science department. Continuing to mine the nearby mountains for precious raw materials, a few outposts are established in cardinal directions to better orient themselves within the crater. However as much as _Thundarando_ has grown, so too have seeds of doubt grown within the crew.<br><br>This round featured the first set of antagonists in the campaign, <b>Agitators</b>, whose objective was to find out why they're really here and share that information with the crew. Equipped with a <b>scrap magaphone</b> and a <b>burning curiosity</b>, the agitators peppered the crew and command with hard questions, trying to draw out difficult answers. With enough cajoling, a nascent riot began to form on the colony, with the overworked security team now having to deal with theats both inside and out.<br><br>As another crushing blizzard set upon the colony, and with their cover beginning to crack, the captain and security team executed the agitators. If only that would be the end of their troubles.
