synopsis: In the third public round of 35 Below, _Vultures Are Circling, And NT Is Burning_, the crew meets the first of several ships meant to rendezvous with the colony.<br><br>With _Thundarando_ well on its way to being established, and an uprising quelled for now, the crew awake two weeks later to begin shoveling out the paths between buildings. Their outposts have been established into a full, fenced-in perimeter, their colony now blossoming with heated crew quarters and common areas. The holdrum, slow morning of the crew is shaken by the arrival of the _NSS Perseverance_ streaking across the sky, falling apart as it entered the atmopshere over the _Banshee Pit_. Emerging from cover, and seeing debris from the crash scattered amongst the colony, the crew rushed northward to search for both survivors and supplies.<br><br>The antagonists for this round were <b>Syndicate Infiltrators</b>, tasked with determining the nature of Nanotrasen's colony and disrupting it any way they could. Being a coordinated sleeper cell aboard the _Perseverance_, they caused the ship to crash-land in the crater, and once rescued began worming their way into the crew's trust. The infilitrators were also tasked with planting four <b>tracking beacons</b> to allow the Syndicate to locate and target the colony's location in the cold depths of space.
