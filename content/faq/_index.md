## What's a 35 Below?

## Will we ever get a sequel or continuation?

There will not be a direct sequel or continuation of the 35 Below project. If there is, it won't be from us. If it is from us, it won't be for a very long time.

35 Below was a labour of love from its contributors and it's better that we actively enjoyed making it happen more than anything else.

## Can I use parts of 35 Below for my own project?

The codebase for 35 Below is provided publicly without guarantee of continued support from us. So long as what you do conforms to the license terms, go nuts.
